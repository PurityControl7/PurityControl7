# About me:

I'm a former classically trained musician with a degree in violin, and I am also proficient in playing the electric guitar, which I actively play and enjoy to this day. Despite my love for music, it led to a dead end as I struggled to find stable and meaningful employment in Croatia.

Being secretly in love with technology my whole life, I eventually enrolled in an entry-level network engineering course at Algebra University College. This ignited a deep interest in network engineering, helping me understand the essential concepts and technologies required for data transport. After completing the course, I successfully passed my CCNA certification as well.

Interestingly, my musical education has been beneficial in understanding technology. Music, with its vast theory, strict rules, exact syntax, and precise execution, shares many conceptual similarities with IT. This background has enhanced my critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and abstract intelligence.

Despite these efforts, I haven't yet secured a job that allows me to grow and reach my potential. In the meantime, I am spontaneously focusing on cybersecurity and penetration testing, fields that perfectly suit my endlessly curious mind. I read, research, and practice daily, constantly expanding my knowledge and documenting my progress here on GitHub.

So far, I've had the most contact with scripting languages like Bash, PowerShell, and Python. I'm also keen on deepening my understanding of assembly language. One of my long-term goals is to analyze, understand, and potentially write my own UEFI bootkits similar to CosmicStrand, which fascinates me deeply. For now, I am focusing on more realistic and pressing goals, one step at a time. While I possess a decent amount of knowledge about cybersecurity and penetration testing techniques, I know there's always more to learn and discover.

Despite the big challenges in my job hunt and poor quality of life, I will never give up. I am committed to this path because nothing compares to my passion for cybersecurity and network engineering.
